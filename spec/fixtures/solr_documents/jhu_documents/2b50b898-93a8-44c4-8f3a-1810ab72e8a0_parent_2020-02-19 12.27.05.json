In 1811, he established his own business located on today's Baltimore Street, which continued after his death in 1854. This map is from Lucas's \"Cabinet Atlas\", and is notable in that it contains the first urban plan, inset within the field of a larger map, to appear in any modern atlas.” Description from: \"Maryland from the Willard Hackerman Map Collection\", George Peabody Library Exhibit Oct. 9 2018 - March 16, 2019: \"Lucas published this map as a plate in his highly acclaimed General Atlas Containing Distinct Maps of all Known… popularly known as “Lucas’s Cabinet Atlas”. What makes this map unique is the large inset map of Baltimore City, often considered the first city map included within a larger map.  Note how the size and content compares to the other Lucas maps of Baltimore. Lucas published many original single sheet maps along with seven atlases. 1 map hand colored; 28 x 49 cm.; Scale: ca. 1:741,776. Hackerman Collection #46",
