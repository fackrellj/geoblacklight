However, this 1968 series provides an additional level of map detail as each of the original gird sections has been subdivided into quarter sections. A map index appears in the margin information of each map sheet.  Each of the 1968 quarter sections has a map scale of 1:1,200 (1 inch = 100 feet). The map scale of earlier grid sections was 1:2,400 (1 inch = 200 feet). There are no images posted for: 3N 5W-1, 5N 2W-4, 2S 1E-3, 3S 3E-4.  Copies of the original printed maps for these sections were not available from theBaltimore City Planning Department, theBaltimore City Department of Transportation, nor theBaltimore City Archives as of May 2016.  We will continue to seek out copies of these missing sheets.  Grid sections 5S 4E-3, 5S 4E-4, 5S 5E-1 cover areas over water only and are not included.
